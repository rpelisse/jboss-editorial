JBoss Editorial
====

Schedule for the [This week in JBoss.org](https://www.jboss.org/) editorial, published every other Thursday.

Editorial contributor's guide
----
Contributors to the JBoss editorials are added to the roster, which then assigns each editor publishing dates for the calendar year.

1. We publish Thursday every two weeks around 7PM (GMT+1). Early on Thursday is fine and Friday is also fine.
* If something arises and you can't deliver your editorial, please try to trade with someone else on the team and update the roster to reflect this change.
* Put a reminder in your calendar so you donâ€™t forget and double check at least check that the reminder automatically sent are indeed arriving in your inbox.
2. How do I find the material for the content of the editorial?
* Any news relevant to the JBoss community can be added into the editorial whatever the source (well, assuming the source is a valid source). However, most of the time, we use the following sources for the content of the editorial:
    * [Planet JBoss](https://planet.jboss.org/)
    * [Red Hat Developer Blog](https://developers.redhat.com/)
    * [Red Hat Middleware Blog](https://middlewareblog.redhat.com/) *(note that last entry as of 2020-06-30 was in January, so the source appears to have dryed out)*
* Warning Note that some item of this feed are non-jboss content, so don't cut'n'paste everything without thinking !
* You can also use the feeds for JBoss.org as a good source: https://github.com/jbossorg/jbossorg.github.io/blob/src/src/data/aggregator-feeds.yaml
3. Communication with the editorial team : Subscribe to the jboss-editorial-team@redhat.com, this is the team list.

Publishing your editorials
----

Here is the workflow for posting editorials to JBoss.org using Github:

* Create a new asciidoc file with the editorial content at [jbossorg/jbossorg.github.io](https://github.com/jbossorg/jbossorg.github.io/tree/src/src/content/posts)
* Commit to the **src** branch.
* Send a heads up for review to jboss-editorial-team@redhat.com

On merge the asciidoc is generated into html and posted to the site.

Note that you can also update [your profile photo](https://github.com/jbossorg/jbossorg.github.io/tree/src/src/img/people).

Editorial layout guidelines
====

As a prime directive: it is your editorial, feel free to write any way you want. Just follow the few guidelines here:

* Title should always be **This week in JBoss ([date-for-thursday-that-week]) - [some-title-you-come-up-with]**.
    * Just copy someones existing title and adjust for your article that week ;)
* Add **tags** based on topics covered before publishing the blog article

If you need help structuring the editorial you can organise the content as suggested below:

* Have a small introduction, written in italic, that summerize the "big news" of the last two weeks (tip: write it last )
* Finish your editorial by adding the following lines (also in italic):
    * *That's all for another edition of the JBoss Editorial, please join us again for more exciting development from the JBoss Communities.*
* Try to regroup all articles about one topic or one product into one section and name it accordingly. Here some section you can use to organise the content:
    * **Techbytes** - you can regroup all "in-depth" technical articles not fitting other section in this one
    * **Releases, releases, releases** - list all the releases of the past two weeks under this section
    * **Decaf'** - any non-Java news can be aggregated into this section (but for the news to make sense, it needs to be somewhat relevant to the JBoss community! Docker or OpenShift news for instance, often falls into this category)
    * **Evangelist's Corner** - Red Hat evangelist, especially Eric D. Schabell, produces a lot of contents between two editorial, I generally regroup them into this section.

Roster and reminder app
====

This project is both holding the roster of the JBoss Weekly Editorial - which states who is in charge of which editorial over the year, but also a small Quarkus app to  generate a calendar (.ics) based on it, along with sending reminder.

The roster itself is a plain text file at the root of the project, the "app" is a scala script along with some Java dependency.

How to use it ?
----

1) How to build the app?

```
mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

2) Generate the calendar

```
java -jar target/jboss-editorial-app-runner.jar -f roster.txt -c jboss-weekly-editorial-2021.ics
```

What is the format file for the roster.txt ?
----

It's plain text, but the app has two expectation regarding it (ie it uses regex to fetch what it needs):

* each author is listed, one line, next to a *3 characters* acronyms;
* each entry starts, on one line, by a *2 digis* week number.

Bottom line, add whatever you want in the file, but prefixed by '#' to avoid messing with its processing  ! In doubt, just run it to generate the calendar, it will most likely complains or crashed if you screwed up something !

What else ?
----

* The calendar is generated for the current year.
* Each author name should follow the RFC regarding email, as it will be directly used as an email address.
